# General Characteristics

## Materials

This is the list of mechanical materials we used while developing the robot:

| Name | Use | Product Image |

### Piece materials

We did an extensive research on observing what material could be used that is both lightweight and impact resistant. The material we first used was MDF, because it was cheap, easy to manufacture, and lightweight, but it wasn't very impact resistant. Other teams where using carbon fiber fillaments or carbon fiber plates, but these were out of our budget. We used PLA to make parts that we couldn't make on MDF, but this material is more heavy and also not impact resistant. 

We ended up settling on ABS, which is a weight intermediate between MDF and PLA, but is very impact resistant. This material, however, is very difficult to print. The results after printing, definetely showed a considerable impact improvement over the MDF used earlier, with only a slight increase on weight. 

The reason we didn't make the robot entirely out of ABS was mostly for time and the difficulty of printing it, but because it's less dense than PLA it would've definetely been better if we made it all out of ABS. Not to mention it would've been more aesthetically pleasing to have it all black.

### Support materials

The materials used to support the robot worked very well. The combination of nylon spacers, metal nuts and screws made it so that we had a sturdy and lightweight support for the pieces. And if the support didn't need to be as sturdy, we used nylon screws and nuts. We also found that the best way to place the spacers is upside down: putting the screw at the bottom and the nut at the top. This is because gravity paired with the vibrations of movement and crashes makes it so that the nuts fall out easier.
