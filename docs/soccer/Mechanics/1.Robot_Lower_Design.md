# Lower Design

## Base

### Initial Considerations

We started by considering a base that could let us maximize the area permited by RCJ rules. This was so that the robot could have many

## Kicker

### Initial Considerations

### Problem

The problem with implementing the kicker was that we didn't focus on it since the beginning and once we wanted to consider it, it would involve basically changing everything about the robot. The base design and the positioning of the motors made it difficult to fit it into our robot. If a kicker would be implemented, we would suggest to follow the base design suggested above.
