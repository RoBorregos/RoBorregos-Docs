## Base

- Initial Considerations

We started by considering a base that could let us maximize the area permited by RCJ rules. This was so that the robot could have many

We ended up following this design

The design did let us maximize the area, but it also caused a few issues. Mainlt the implementation of the kicker and other

## Kicker

- Initial Considerations

We thought that the kicker was not very 

- Problem

The problem with implementing the kicker was that we didn't focus on it since the beginning and once we wanted to consider it, it would involve basically changing everything about the robot. The base design and the positioning of the motors made it difficult to fit it into our robot. If a kicker would be implemented, we would suggest to follow the base design suggested above.
