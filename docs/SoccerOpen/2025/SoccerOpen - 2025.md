## Features

### [Github](https://github.com/RoBorregos/robocup-soccer-open-2025)

ü§ñ Processing Breakdown:
- Teensy 4.1: Organices data recolected and processed by camara, phototransistors, BNO, and manages them for core logic and movement. 
- OpenMV: Camaras with algorithms for ball and both goals detection using computer vision.

üéÆ Movement Cotrol: Used 2 PID for a smother control ensuring a precise movement:

- Translational PID: Guides robot to the ball or goal with camara.
- Angular PID: Corrects the direction of the robot with angular velocity correction.
- Dribbler PID: Adjust robot movement for a soft approach to the ball with the robots front. 
- Ominidirectional movement: Omnidirectional movement using 4 wheels with 90 degree separation. 

‚öΩBall detection: Image processing for pixel mapping using LAB values and merged blobs tracking to determine ball distance and angles in a [180, -180] angle normalization. 

ü•ÖGoal detection: Using merged blobs to encapsulate goal in a rectangle with a corresponding center used as reference for distance and angle measurements.
