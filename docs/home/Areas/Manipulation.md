# Manipulation

Dynamic manipulation systems are crucial for advancing robotics because they allow robots to interact with their environments in ways that go far beyond pre-programmed actions. This capability is  particularly important for service robotics, where robots must navigate unstructured and unpredictable environments. Dynamic manipulation helps robots sense changes, modify trajectories, and grasp objects with variations in shape, size, and material. This opens the door to more complex tasks, from assisting with meal preparation to handling delicate objects in healthcare settings. The ability to adapt in real-time also promotes safe and seamless human-robot collaboration.

Our physical implementation consists of a 6-DOF Xarm6 robotic arm utilizing MoveIt for trajectory planning. We developed custom picking and placing functionalities, incorporating additional libraries and algorithms, and leveraging feedback from a Zed2 stereo camera.
