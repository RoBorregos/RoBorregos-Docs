# Overview

The area of integration and networks is concerned about how all the modules are connected, including hardware and software. 

Integration is a key part of the project, since it is the way to connect all the modules and make them work together. You must have an idea of how the modules are connected and how they communicate with each other. And also how all the modules are working.

Also you need to be aware of hardware issues and when you need to change some hardware configuration, for example, if you need more jetson nano devices, in order to have more local processing power.
