# Manipulation

Manipulation is one of the most essential and challenging aspects of robotics, enabling robots to physically interact with their environment to perform meaningful tasks.

## Our Innovative Pipeline

We have developed a pipeline that empowers a 6-degree-of-freedom robotic arm and gripper to execute object manipulation by seamlessly integrating:

- **Image Processing**
- **Perception**
- **Motion Planning Components**

## Object-Picking Phase

- **Data Fusion**: Enhance 2D object detection data with 3D point cloud information using the **Point Cloud Library (PCL)**.
- **Plane Extraction**: Utilize **RANSAC algorithms** to extract planes from the point cloud.
- **Object Segmentation**: Segment clusters corresponding to detected objects.
- **Grasp Planning**: Process detections with the **Grasp Pose Detection (GPD) library**.
- **Trajectory Generation**: Use **MoveIt!** to generate collision-free trajectories for grasping.

## Motion Planning

- **Primitive Movements**: Employ primitive movements for pick-and-place operations.
  - **Benefits**:
    - Faster planning.
    - Maintains the end effector's orientation.
    - Ideal for tasks like serving breakfast that don't require collision avoidance.
- **Collision Avoidance**: When necessary, alternative planning methods are used to navigate around obstacles.

## Placing Algorithm

- **Surface Isolation**: Isolate the table surface using **RANSAC**.
- **Heat Map Creation**: Generate a heat map of available space based on a Gaussian distribution.
- **Optimal Placement**: Select the region with the maximum accessible space as the placing pose.

When collision avoidance is necessary, we employ alternative planning methods.
