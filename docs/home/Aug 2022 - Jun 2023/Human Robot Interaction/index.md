# Human Robot Interaction

In Roborregos the previous work was developed only considering [speech](speech/index.md), a subset of HRI that involves the use of speech recognition and speech synthesis to enable verbal communication between humans and robots. Also the hardware setup of the area and the software modules that are used were developed 

The last implementation to get the entities of the text was using GPT-3 API.

Also [Human Analysis]("../vision/Human Analysis/index.md") area was develop, a basis for the development of natural behavior between humans and robots using computer vision techniques.

Currently we are working on the development of the area considering features such as gestures, facial expressions, and body language recognition to enhance the human-robot interaction experience. By incorporating these features, robots can better understand and respond to non-verbal cues from humans, leading to more effective communication and collaboration.
