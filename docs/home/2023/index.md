# Achievements from 2023

This year development is focused around expanding and updating the software areas of our current hardware setup, with a new project based on the development of a custom omnidirectional mobile base.

## [Electronics and Control](Electronics%20and%20Control/index.md)
- Started development of PCBs for the omnidirectional mobile base.
- Standardized the electronics of the main robot for full 24V operation.

## [Mechanics](Mechanics/index.md)
- Started development of the omnidirectional mobile base, with an octagonal shape and 4 omnidirectional wheels.
- Designed and started manufacturing of several new grippers.
- Redesigned the electronics protections for the Dashgo and Xarm6.

## [Human Robot Interaction](Human%20Robot%20Interaction/index.md)
### Speech Recognition
- Developed a ROS node for speech recognition using Whisper, replacing our online solution from Azure.

### Action Interpretation
- Developed custom fine tuned GPT-3.5 model for action interpretation, with emphasis on a more flexible and human-like interpretation of voice commands.

### Robot Interface
- Developed a ROS Node for continuous arm movement to follow the user, enhancing the robot's interaction capabilities.
- Installed and started development on an on-robot tablet for user interaction, including RVIZ and camera visualization and a custom interface for the robot's services.

## [Integration and Networks](Integration%20and%20Networks/index.md)
### ROS
- Replaced a previous web socket solution for communicating two roscores with a multimaster solution, allowing for more robust and faster communication between the robot software modules.
- Started development of ROS2 migration.

## [Computer Vision](Computer%20Vision/index.md)
### Human Recognition
- Replaced DeepFace for face_recognition from dlib, allowing for faster and more accurate face recognition.
- Developed a custom human attribute recognition using the PETA dataset.
  
### Object Detection
- Migrated to Yolov8 for object detection.
- Increased adaptability and ease of use of the automated dataset generation method.
- Started development of a custom dataset generation tool based on 3D scanning.

## [Navigation](Navigation/index.md)
### Dashgo B1 mobile base
- Developed a node for fusing LIDAR and on-arm depth camera for better obstacle avoidance.
- Started work on a person follower node integrating SLAM for navigation on unknown environments.

### Omnidirectional Mobile Base
- Started development of the omnidirectional mobile base, with a custom ROS node for control and odometry.
- Integrated Hector SLAM for mapping and localization.

## [Manipulation](Manipulation/index.md)
### Planning and Hardware
- Replaced Xarm5 for a Xarm6, as well as designed new custom grippers.
- Migrated the planning and arm control computation to the Jetson AGX Xavier, for stable compute times and a more reliable ethernet-based communication with the arm.
- Started a migration from MoveIt planning to faster alternatives.

### Pick and Place
- Increased accuracy and stability of the pick process.
- Developed two place methods, one with a graph based approach and another using clustering for identifying possible placing areas.
