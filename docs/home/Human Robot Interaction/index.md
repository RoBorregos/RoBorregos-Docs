# Overview

**Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)** refers to the study and design of interactions between humans and robots. It encompasses the development of technologies, interfaces, and systems that enable effective communication, collaboration, and cooperation between humans and robots. HRI aims to create intuitive and natural ways for humans to interact with robots, allowing for seamless integration of robots into various domains such as healthcare, manufacturing, entertainment, and personal assistance.

In Roborregos, our work has been to develop skills in different areas of robotics that pursue these objectives, such as:

- **Human physical analysis ([vision](../vision/Human%20Analysis/index.md)):** a basis for the development of natural behavior between humans and robots using computer vision techniques. Currently, we are working on the development of the area considering features such as gestures, facial expressions, and body language recognition to enhance the human-robot interaction experience. By incorporating these features, robots can better understand and respond to non-verbal cues from humans, leading to more effective communication and collaboration.

- **Verbal communication ([speech](speech/index.md)):** it involves the use of speech recognition and speech synthesis to enable verbal communication between humans and robots. The implementation to get important entities from a text has been made using [GPT-3 API](speech/GPT-3%20API.md). In addition, the hardware setup of the area and the software modules that are used were developed.

- **Information display:** This tool has been implemented to visually display the robot's current situations to the user, enabling them to manage certain actions and interact effectively through text.
