# @Home

Welcome to the @Home competition documentation of [RoBorregos](https://roborregos.com), Robotics Representative Group of [Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx). This documentation serves as a guide for our project, which focuses on developing multiproposal software modules for the [RoboCup@Home](https://athome.robocup.org/) competition. Our goal is to create a comprehensive software architecture that enables robots to perform various tasks that humans typically handle on a daily basis.

## About the Competition

The RoboCup@Home league is a part of the RoboCup initiative and is the largest annual competition for autonomous service robots. Its goal is to develop service and assistive robot technology for future domestic applications. The competition evaluates robots abilities in a realistic home environment through benchmark tests. 
The focus areas include: 

- Human-Robot Interaction
- Navigation and Mapping
- Computer Vision
- Object Manipulation
- System Integration

The RoboCup@Home competition is divided into three categories: the [Domestic Standard Platform League](https://www.robocup.org/leagues/34) (DSPL), the [Social Standard Platform League](https://www.robocup.org/leagues/15) (SSPL), and the [Open Platform League](https://www.robocup.org/leagues/14) (OPL). Our team competes in the Open Platform League.

In the [Open Platform League](https://www.robocup.org/leagues/14), we have the opportunity to explore and showcase our innovations and advancements without limitations on the choice of hardware platforms. This category allows us to push the boundaries of robotics and demonstrate our capabilities in a variety of areas.

## Project Objective

The main objective  is to actively explore and integrate state-of-the-art technologies in the field of robotics. Through our participation in the RoboCup@Home competition's Open Platform League, we aim to demonstrate our knowledge, skills, and innovative thinking in developing advanced robotic systems. By leveraging cutting-edge hardware and software, we strive to push the boundaries of current technology and create innovative solutions for real-world problems.
