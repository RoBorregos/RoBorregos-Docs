# IMU

Our robotâ€™s orientation sensing was provided by a BNO055 inertial measurement unit (IMU), which was positioned at the top of the robot to minimize interference from the motors, metal structures, and other electronic components. This placement allowed the sensor to capture cleaner data for calculating absolute heading, which was essential for maintaining orientation on the field and coordinating ball tracking with goal alignment. The BNO055 fed this orientation data into our control system, enabling more precise movement adjustments and improving overall navigation during play.
