# Vision

The vision system of our robot was built around a Pixy2 camera, which was responsible for detecting and tracking the goalposts during play. This information complemented the data from the ball detection system and allowed the robot to aim more effectively when approaching or preparing to shoot. The Pixy2 was mounted at the front of the robot, positioned to provide a clear and unobstructed view of the field. One critical consideration in our setup was ensuring that no cables near the camera were colored yellow or blue, as these are the official colors of the RoboCup goalposts.
