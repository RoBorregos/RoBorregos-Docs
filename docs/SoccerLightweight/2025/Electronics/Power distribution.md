# Power distribution

Our robots were powered by 11.1V LiPo batteries, which we selected because they offer high energy density, delivering a large amount of power in a compact and lightweight form. This made them particularly well suited for mobile robots where minimizing both weight and size is critical. Another important advantage of LiPo batteries is their ability to provide the high current demanded by our motors during moments of intense activity, such as rapid maneuvers and physical interactions during matches. However, these batteries do require careful handling. LiPo cells are sensitive to over-discharge, and if their voltage drops below a safe limit, they can become damaged or lose capacity permanently. To prevent this, we integrated a voltmeter into the robot so that we could continuously monitor the battery charge during operation and replace batteries before they reached dangerous levels. Despite the need for this extra caution, we found LiPo batteries to be the best choice because no alternative matched their combination of power, weight, and size for competitive performance.

To ensure stable and efficient power delivery throughout the system, we incorporated Mini 560 DC-DC step-down converters into the main PCB. These converters regulated the battery voltage to supply 12 volts for the motor drivers, 5 volts for the microcontroller and most sensors, and 3.3 volts for specific components.
