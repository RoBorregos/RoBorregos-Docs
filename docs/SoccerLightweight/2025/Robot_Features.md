# Robot Features
Our robot system has been designed with several key features that improve flexibility, modularity, and precision in its operation, enabling easier adjustments and enhancements for future developments.

 **1.Standardized Speed Range**

To ensure consistent control and make the system more modular, we standardized the robotâ€™s speed by setting it within a range of 0 to 1. This approach allows for easy adjustments to the speed control algorithm and ensures compatibility across different microcontrollers, simplifying any potential hardware changes.

**2. Moving Average for Sensor Data**

To improve sensor accuracy and stability, we implemented a moving average algorithm that processes real-time data from sensors, such as the phototransistors and the camera. This algorithm smooths out noise and fluctuating values, providing a more reliable reading. The moving average is calculated as a moving average of the previous moving averages, effectively creating a "weighted" smoother for the sensor data.

**3. Dual-Ring Phototransistor Array with Multiplexer**

We use a dual-ring phototransistor array for line and light detection, optimized with an 8-to-1 multiplexer for each board. This setup allows for a larger number of phototransistors to be integrated into the robot, enhancing its ability to detect lines and light changes from multiple directions.

- **Multiplexer:** Each board is equipped with an 8-to-1 multiplexer, enabling the system to read data from up to 8 phototransistors with a single input, reducing the complexity of wiring and improving sensor efficiency.
- **Dual-Ring Setup:** The dual-ring configuration of the phototransistors ensures broader coverage for line detection, allowing for more precise tracking and better response to dynamic field conditions.

**4. Three-Board Sensor Configuration**
To enhance detection accuracy and redundancy, the robot is equipped with three sensor boards positioned around the robot. Each board includes an array of phototransistors and a multiplexer, working together to provide comprehensive coverage of the robot's surroundings, allowing it to react quickly and effectively to changes in the environment.
