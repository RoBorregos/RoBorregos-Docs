# Power Supply

3.7V LIPO batteries were used
For the power supply, 3 lipo batteries of 3.7V at 2500 maH were used in a series arrangement, giving them approximately 11.1 v in nominal state.

For the logic supply, lipo batteries of 3.7V at 1200 maH were used in a serious arrangement, giving them approximately 7 V in nominal state.

The batteries played an important role in the elaboration of our robot because the weight of the battery is relatively heavy compared to other components such as the driver or the Arduino Board itself.

## Why did we use LiPo Batteries?

### High energy density
LiPo batteries offer a higher energy density compared to traditional battery technologies like nickel-cadmium (NiCd) or nickel-metal hydride (NiMH). This means they can store more energy per unit volume or weight, providing longer operating times and increased power for portable devices.

### Lightweight and compact
LiPo batteries are incredibly lightweight and have a slim profile, making them ideal for applications where space and weight are critical factors. They are commonly used in drones, RC vehicles, smartphones, and wearable devices, allowing for more compact designs and improved portability.

### High discharges rates
LiPo batteries can deliver high discharge rates, making them suitable for applications that require bursts of high power. This characteristic is particularly advantageous in robotics, electric vehicles, and high-performance hobbyist applications.


### Fast charging
LiPo batteries can be charged at a much faster rate compared to other battery chemistries. They can accept higher charge currents, reducing charging times and improving overall device usability.
