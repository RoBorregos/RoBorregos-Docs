# Power Supply

For power, two batteries were used.

## Movement Power
For the motors, a 11.1V 2250 mAh battery was used; this is because the motors require 12V and so as not to worry about how long they would last, we bought them with a lot of amperage.

## Logic Power
For logic, two 3.7V Lipo batteries were used connected in series to obtain 7.4V, these batteries have an amperage of 2500 mAh.



It was decided to use this type of batteries because they are very good in relation to electronic projects; likewise, their duration was very optimal when it came to being in the competition.
