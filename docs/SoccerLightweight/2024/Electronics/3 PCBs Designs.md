# PCBs Designs

For the design of the PCBs, we used the EasyEda app. Three types of boards were made on it.

## Main Board
The main board included the microcontroller, as well as the sensors that would be used; additional digital/analog pins were added in case they were needed.

## Phototransistors Board
The other boards were made for the phototransistors, which were used for the lower part of the robot for line detection. It was considered to use them with a multiplexer, but for reasons of complexity, they were connected directly to the analog pins of the microcontroller.

## IR Ring Board
It was decided to reuse last year's IR ring due to its complexity and the short time we had to develop something different. With this IR ring, we were able to work very well on the electronic part because it was connected to the microcontroller's serial port.
