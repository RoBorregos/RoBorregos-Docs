The rescue kit deployment mechanism consists of a rack and pinion mechanism design to deploy kits on different sides of the robot, the design had quite a few changes and problems such as the difficulty of centering the servo motor to grab more kits in the storage tower however we mechanically increased the margin that could have the servo and through coding we managed to have a more reliable system.

Even so, it was never as reliable as we would expect, starting with how careful we had to be sometimes just to put the kits in.

To avoid this I think having heavier kits would somehow help but above all try to make the mechanism as simple as possible over any other advantage.

Among the good things the design had  was the space occupied, and how “unobtrusive” it was, using only a free part below the base and without having to put a prominent tower, however except for the tower that could interfere in case of using a lidar, these advantages were mostly aesthetic.
