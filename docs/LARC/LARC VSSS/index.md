# Latin American Robotics Competition Very Small Size Soccer

The IEEE Very Small Size Soccer (VSSS) is a robotics competition where teams design and program small autonomous robots to play soccer in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. The competition simulates a real soccer match but on a much smaller scale, with robots operating autonomously without remote control.

The essence of VSSS lies in robotics challenges such as real-time perception, decision-making, control systems, and multi-robot coordination.

## Competition Goal

The primary objective is to score more goals than the opposing team within a set match duration. Each team consisting of three robots.
