Since a way to detect the color objects is available, the robot just needed to detect the color squares and compare the sequence. For this, it is important to have a lot of filters, since the color cubes have almost the same color. So in order to prevent false patron detection, the strategy was to implement only reading the upper colors, and the condition was that they were within a margin in the “x” and “y” directions of the other colors of the sequences. Doing this, it was possible to detect the most possible “x” position of our robot, since it is only necessary to check the sequence and the most centered color.
