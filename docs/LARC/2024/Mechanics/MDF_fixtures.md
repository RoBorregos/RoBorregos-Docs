## MDF

Generally speaking, Medium-Density Fibreboard is a great material to build out a simple structure or prototype. The key aspect is its easy manufacturability and cost. However, when designing the base of a robot, that needs to be sturdy, there are some limitations. Feel free to mix and combine fixture elements such as bolts and nuts. Since these components act perpendicular to the fibres there is not much to worry about. Just as with 3D printed parts, the material is most vulnerable when applying loads parallel to the layers of the material. Therefore, adhesive fixtures are not recommended.
