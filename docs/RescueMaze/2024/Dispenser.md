# Dispenser

The rescue kit deployment mechanism consists of a rack and pinion mechanism design to deploy kits on different sides of the robot, the design had quite a few changes and problems such as the difficulty of centering the servo motor to grab more kits in the storage tower however we mechanically increased the margin that could have the servo and through coding we managed to have a more reliable system.
