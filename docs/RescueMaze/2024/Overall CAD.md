# Overall CAD 

The entire robot was designed from scratch using SolidWorks so that each element along with all the components to be used were integrated and had their own place.

The chassis was built thinking about making the robot as low as possible but keeping a minimum height of 2cm below its base to be able to pass the speed bumps.

We included a box to storage the batteries, store them at the bottom was useful to lower the center of mass, and not overturning on the ramps. The box was meant to be retractible, a great idea but with bad implementation since the 3D printed part tended to break, at the and we use screws to attached it to the main mdf frame.
