# @RescueMaze - 2025

The main developments during 2025 with respect to previous years are the following:
- Danger zone was added
- Speed bumps are not allowed to be placed on ramps or stairs
- Stairs may be used to change the level of the floor, similar to a ramp
- The 'exit bonus' condition is satisfied when the robot returns to the starting tile. On the
 starting tile, the robot has to blink (ON: 1s, OFF: 1s) with the same LED or display that is used to
 identify a victim (see 3.3.11) for at least 10 seconds
- The rubrics include a video
- For all the changes, see: [Maze-2025-Rules](https://junior.robocup.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RCJRescueMaze2025-draft-1.pdf)
